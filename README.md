CODICE FISCALE

It's the Italian tax id system and it's based on personal data. In this program, you input your first name, last name, sex, date and place of birth and the output is the calculation of your own tax id. It doesn't account for homonymy but it's accurate in every other way.

The outputted tax id consists of:
- three letters for the last name(s)
- three letters for the name(s)
- two numbers for the birth year
- one letter for the birth month
- two numbers for the birth day and sex
- one letter and three numbers for the birth place (including foreign countries)
- one control letter

Here are the details of how it is calculated: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fiscal_code
